Please contact for any query: 8976258876</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Procedure for Requesting Change of Name (Succession/Transfer) for Electricity Connection.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To guide customers through the seamless process of transferring an electricity connection to a new name (due to property purchase, inheritance, etc.) via the online portal.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This process is for <strong>intra-state transfers within Maharashtra</strong>. For new connections or complete disconnections, a different procedure applies.</p>
<hr />
<h4><strong>Step 1: Prerequisites - MUST DO Before Starting Online Application</strong></h4>
<p>Before you click "Apply," ensure these two critical steps are completed. Missing this will cause rejection of your application.</p>
<p><strong>1. Update Your Registered Mobile Number &amp; Email ID:</strong>
   * The entire process is OTP (One-Time Password) and email-driven.
   * <strong>If your mobile number and/or email ID are NOT updated</strong> in our current records, you <strong>cannot proceed online</strong>.
   * <strong>Action Required:</strong> You must <strong>visit your nearest MSEB facilitation center</strong> to update these details first.

<p><strong>2. Obtain the Mandatory Documents: Form X (Consent Letter for SD Transfer) &amp; NOC</strong>
   * This is the most crucial document for name transfer.
   * <strong>What is Form X?</strong> It is the official <strong>Consent Letter for Service Division (SD) Transfer</strong>, a declaration-cum-indemnity form.
   * <strong>How to get it?</strong>
        a. <strong>Contact our Facility Manager (FM)</strong> assigned to our building.
        b. <strong>Carry the recent paid electricity bill</strong> (of the existing connection holder) for identification.
        c. The <strong>FM will provide you with the signed Form X and a No Objection Certificate (NOC)</strong> upon verification.
        d. You will need a <strong>clear scanned copy (PDF/JPEG) of this signed Form X &amp; NOC</strong> to upload during the online application.</p>
